{"name":"Experiments with real time analytics on high velocity streaming data","tagline":"Independent study project","body":"### About\r\nThe intention of this project is to design a system that is capable of processing high velocity data streams (referred to as hoses) in real-time in order to provide analytics on the data, or to improve or optimize an existing open source system of this nature, such as Storm, S4, or Samza.\r\n\r\n### Milestones\r\nThis is a tentative list of milestones for the project:\r\n\r\n####Research existing systems\r\nThere are various platforms and frameworks for real-time stream processing, and understanding their motivations and working mechanism can be helpful. \r\n\r\n####Deep dive and understand limitations\r\nExisting systems may have certain limitations that can offer scope for improvement and optimizations.\r\n\r\n####Select data space\r\nThere are various real-time streaming data spaces available, like a broadcast stream of every change being made to wikipedia, one for each taxi trip taken in NYC, twitter live streams, RSVP data on meetup.com, etc. I'll be considering each of the datasets for their suitability, based on whether I can control the feeds per unit of time (so that evaluation on performance metrics can be done for varying velocities), and whether the streams provide data useful enough for meaningful analytics.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis is an independent project, being contributed to by @ankit-kapur.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
